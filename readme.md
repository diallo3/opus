# OPUS Components

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/diallo3/opus.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
